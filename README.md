# Vibe Coding Manager

**English** | [中文](README.zh-CN.md) · [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)

A desktop app for managing your Vibe Coding projects, built with Tauri v2.

## Features

- **Project management** — add, edit, delete projects
- **Run target** — local machine / server
- **Server management** — configure SSH servers (host, port, user, password/key login method)
- **Grouping** — group projects, collapsible sidebar, click to locate, rename a group inline (hover → pencil; all projects in it move together)
- **Built-in terminal** — in-app bottom-drawer tabbed terminal managing all sessions; file tree, file preview, color themes, font size, drag-to-insert path; closing a tab asks first and reminds you to let the AI update its memory (see [Using the terminal](#using-the-built-in-terminal))
- **Multi AI CLI launch** — start **Claude / Codex / opencode / Gemini / agy** in a project directory from the project card, with a tool badge on the tab
- **Scan & import** — batch-import git projects from a directory (auto-reads remote, dedups by path)
- **Search** — quickly filter by name, path, description
- **Export** — export project data to Excel
- **Cross-platform** — macOS (Apple Silicon) + Windows (x64 / ARM64)
- **Local storage** — data saved to local JSON files

## Project fields

- Name
- Local path
- Remote repository URL
- Group
- Run target (local / server)
- Server association
- Description

## Using the built-in terminal

A bottom-drawer terminal — open it from a project card's terminal icon or the floating button at the bottom-right.

**Launch an AI CLI**
- Click the terminal icon on a project card → a menu pops up: **Open Claude / Open Codex / Open opencode / Open Gemini / Open agy**
- A new tab is created, `cd`s into the project directory and runs the command; the tab shows a tool badge (claude orange / codex blue / opencode green / gemini purple / agy cyan)
- The **+** at the top-left opens a blank terminal (no CLI)
- Prerequisite: the corresponding CLI (`codex` / `opencode` / `gemini` / `agy`) must be installed and on your PATH (the terminal uses a login shell, so it will find them)

**File tree + preview** (left)
- The tree is rooted at the active tab's project directory and follows tab switches; folders load lazily on click
- **Single-click a file** → preview on the right; **double-click** → insert its path into the terminal
- **Drag** a file/folder from the tree onto the terminal → inserts its path (handy for pointing an AI session at a directory)
- Drag the middle splitter to resize the tree; the folder toolbar icon collapses/expands it

**Supported preview formats**
- **Code / config / text**: syntax highlighting (dozens of languages)
- **Images**: png / jpg / gif / webp / svg / ico / avif (checkerboard transparency background)
- **PDF**: inline rendering
- **Markdown**: rendered as a formatted page, with a Source / Rendered toggle (XSS-sanitized, safe to preview from any source)
- **CSV / TSV**: rendered as a table, switchable back to source

**Right-click menu** (any file/folder in the tree)
- **Open folder** (folder → open in system file manager; file → open its containing folder)
- **Insert path into terminal** / **Copy path**
- **Move to Trash** (recoverable; asks for confirmation first)

**Color themes**
- Toggle via the palette toolbar icon: **Default Dark** / **Homebrew** (black background, green text); your choice is remembered

**Font size**
- `⌘/Ctrl +` to enlarge, `⌘/Ctrl -` to shrink, `⌘/Ctrl 0` to reset, or `⌘/Ctrl + wheel`

**Drag to insert path**
- Drag a file/folder from Finder / File Explorer onto the terminal panel → its path (quoted if it contains spaces) is written into the active terminal

## Download

Grab the build for your platform from [Releases](https://github.com/luckylee6666/vibe-coding-manage/releases):

| Platform | File |
| --- | --- |
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | `VibeCodingManager_x.y.z_aarch64.dmg` |
| Windows x64 | `..._x64-setup.exe` (installer) or `..._x64_en-US.msi` |
| Windows ARM64 | `..._arm64-setup.exe` (installer) or `..._arm64_en-US.msi` (Surface / Snapdragon ARM devices) |

### macOS install

The app is unsigned, so the first launch is blocked by macOS:

1. Open the `.dmg` and drag `Vibe Coding Manager.app` into Applications
2. The first launch shows "cancelled" / "move to Trash"
3. Open **System Settings → Privacy & Security** and scroll to the bottom
4. Under "Security" you'll see `"Vibe Coding Manager" was blocked because it is from an unidentified developer`
5. Click **Open Anyway**, confirm with your password

### Windows install

Unsigned, so SmartScreen will warn on first run:

1. Download the `*-setup.exe` for your architecture and double-click to install
2. If **"Windows protected your PC"** appears, click **More info → Run anyway**
3. Pick x64 or ARM64 to match your CPU architecture
